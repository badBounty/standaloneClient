Remember to be careful when using AWS Regions, specially with the lambda functions to be created and bucket locations.
For this example we will be using us-east-2, which is US East (Ohio) for S3 buckets

Open standaloneClient.py.
line 11, modify desired partition size (bytes)
line 42, modify FunctionName to desired orquestrator name, we will call the function "orqTest"
line 85, modify with AWS keys and region

Go to IAM console, go to Roles, create new role with the following policies:

AWSLambdaFullAccess
AmazonS3FullAccess
CloudWatchFullAccess

Save the role ARN

Go to s3 console.
We will now create 2 buckets, one for saving the exfiltrated files and the other one for saving our template functions.
Save the names for each one of those. We will call them
exfiltrationbucket & templatebucket

open sampleFunction.py and modify line 6 with the exfiltration bucket name.
Compress the function and upload it to our templatebucket, remember the name.

Go to lambda console
Create lambda function called "orqTest"
Copy and paste the contents of the orquestrator function in the newly created lambda function.
Line 26, replace with IAM role ARN
Line 29, replace with template bucket name
Line 30, Replace with compressed function name

Use the existing created role for this function.
